<h2>Project Description</h2>

	<div>
		<ul>
			<li>What is the problem?</li> 
				<a>If nothing is done, Climate Change will drastically alter our world as we know it. </a>
				<a>It will end human civilization, ruin our ecosystem, and kill billions of creatures. </a> <br>
				<a>The world is in an environmental crisis, and there is not enough being done to combat this crisis. </a>
				<a>Many don’t care about climate changes, don’t know enough about it, </a> <br>
				<a>or have been misinformed about how our world is changing and how fast it’s changing. </a> 
				<br>
				<a>In order to ensure that we have a future ahead of us, we need to educate everyone, especially our youth.</a>
				<a>To help children, teenagers, and young adults empathize with our environment </a> <br>
				<a>and have a clearer vision of the scale of change our climate is going through, </a>
				<a>we need to begin their education on a smaller, more understandable level.</a>
				<br><br>
			<li>What is our solution?</li>
				<a>Our solution is a web application that automatically generates environmental science presentations </a>
				<a>for grade school teachers, ranging from elementary to high school teachers. </a> <br>
				<a>These presentations will be tailored to the school’s local area, </a>
				<a>so students can better understand the environment changes around them, how these changes may be happening elsewhere, </a> <br>
				<a>and the context for other changes to the environment globally
				<br><br>
			<li>What is our desired outcome</li>
				<a>GeoLearn wants to educate our youth with correct and interesting information to motivate them </a>
				<a>to care about the environment and pique their interest, so they may grow up to be more </a> <br>
				<a>environmentally conscious, fight for more environmentally friendly practices from their governments and corporations, </a>
				<a>and possibly pursue careers in environmental sciences. </a>
				<br><br>

				<a>The initial concept for this project was provided by our sponsor in 
				the form of</a>

<h2>High Level Requirements</h2>
<h3>The Framework:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>First start using different Google APIs</li>
	<ul>
		<li>The Google Earth Engine API</li>
		<li>The Google Google Drive Presentation API</li>
		<ul>
			<li>We need to get these two APIs to interact with each other to better create automated presentations for teachers. </li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>We need to make a GUI that is easy to interact with from its end users.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Must have the ability to grant admin tools to whoever is properly assigned to do so.</li>
		<li>Menu options must be easy to find and easy to use for each user.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>When a presentation is generated, it must have the most accurate information possible about the topic the user chose.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Must work with other applications in order to find this inforation.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Google Scholar.</li>
			<li>Wikipedia.</li>
			<li>etc.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Possibly have the capability to of being pre-extracted and stored in a database</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Must have visuals for each presentaion.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Must have color.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Maps.</li>
			<li>Animal Photos.</li>
			<li>etc.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>Web application must have the capability to be saved to any modern web browser.</li>
	<li>Must have a basic admin interface.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Teacher Interactive Tools:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Must allow the user the ability to upload their own content.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Videos.</li>
		<li>Pictures.</li>
		<li>etc.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Must have a rating system for any uploaded content so teachers can see what is considered to be the best content.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Have different labels if content is from the local area and/or if the content was uploaded by a professional.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Users must be allowed to set age demographic for the presentations they want generated.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>The younger the user, the more interactive it must be.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<h3>Student Interaction Tools:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Students must have accounts.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Teachers create these accounts for students.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Each presentations must have interactive capabilities.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Quizzes.</li>
		<li>Questionaires.</li>
		<li>etc.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Each form of interactive elements must have the capability to be rated by students.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Envisioned Solution</h2>
<p>We will be creating a web application that can be accessed worldwide. This application will be used to help teachers create presentations</p>
<p>about environmental events (either in real-time, past events and/or future predictions) for elementary students to undersatnd. These</p>
<p>presentations must be engaging, through interesting information and interactive activities. The teachers can upload and rate content based</p>
<p>on how reliable and relevant they are to their chosen topic. Each presentation must be tailored to different grade levels so all students</p>
<p>can understand this content better. With this web application, we can get environmental information out easier, as well as make it interesting</p>
<p>for everyone that uses it.</p>
