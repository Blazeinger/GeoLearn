	<h3 style="margin-left:15%;">How do I create slides?</h3>
	<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right: 15%">Creating slides with Enviroslides is easy. First go to the slides page. Then, you have to select
	your difficulty on the presentations, choose your location, place your email address and school name. 
	Once that is done, all you need to do is push "Generate Slides" and then your slides will be sent to
	you on your Google Drive. (*Note: This will take some time before it is sent.)</p>
	
	<h3 style="margin-left:15%;">What topics can I pick?</h3>
	<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right: 15%">Right now we are only able to create climate change and biodiversity slides. Climate change being
	about the changing climate patterns around the world. Biodiversity about the many animals that inhabit
	the Earth along with us, as well as what used to live on Earth.</p>
	
	<h3 style="margin-left:15%;">Do I need a Google Email?</h3>
	<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right: 15%">Yes, we need to have a Google Email in order to share to a Google Drive. Currently, we are only able
	create Google Slides presentations, not powerpoint.</p>
	
	<h3 style="margin-left:15%;">Can I edit my presentations?</h3>
	<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right: 15%">Absolutely! We will only provide information based on the topic and a template that we have in place. 
	However, we hope that you feel free to edit the presentations once they show uo in your drive as you see
	fit. These presentations are personalized for you, so we belive you should be allowed to change them if you
	wish to.</p>
	
	<h3 style="margin-left:15%;">How accurate are these slides?</h3>
	<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right: 15%">We have been working with a research team, who is also our client, to create these presentations that 
	provide accurate information on both topics being presented.</p>
